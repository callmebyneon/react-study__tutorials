# Add functions to practice

Tutorial gave some ideas for improvements that I could mke to the tic-tac-toe gmae which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

   
And I tried to make all of these, but I can't understand #1 means. So, In this branch, add the codes for #2 ~ #6.
